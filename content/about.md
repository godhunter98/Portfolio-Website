I’m **Harsh Malik**, a curiosity-driven builder who likes working where  
**machine learning, AI tooling, and financial systems** intersect.

Right now I’m a **Product Analyst – AI & Data** at Citi, where I help design and test GenAI tools (OpenAI, Gemini, RAG) to make real workflows faster and less painful. Before that, I worked in **Financial Planning & Analysis**, building forecasting models, KPIs, and dashboards for a UK pension fund client.

## 🧠 What I like working on

I’m happiest when I’m building things that are both **technical and useful**:

- **ML & LLM experiments** – from-scratch transformers, text-to-SQL models, CNNs  
- **Developer & analyst tools** – CLIs, small web apps, dashboards, little “power tools”  
- **Finance & data problems** – forecasting, risk/return, portfolio tracking, process automation  

On GitHub you’ll find projects like:

- `nano_transformers` – a GPT-style model implemented in PyTorch  
- Text-to-SQL finetuned LLMs for analytics workflows  
- A **CLI portfolio tracker** using SQLite + Yahoo Finance  
- A **Fashion-MNIST CNN** with a small Streamlit demo

## 📚 How I learn

My learning style is simple:

> 1. Find a concept that feels slightly scary.  
> 2. Implement it end-to-end.  
> 3. Explain it in **plain language** until it feels obvious.

That’s how I’ve approached:

- Transformers and attention  
- Basic RL and model training loops  
- Concurrency, APIs, and backend patterns in Python  
- Financial modelling and derivatives

## 🔍 What I’m exploring now

- Making **LLM-powered tools** that are actually reliable enough to use at work  
- Better personal finance & analytics dashboards for myself and friends  
- Cleaner ways to package small experiments so others can play with them too  

If any of this overlaps with what you’re building—or what your team is hiring for—  
I’d love to talk.
