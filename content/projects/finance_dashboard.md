title: "Personal Finance Dashboard – Net Worth & Asset Allocation"
date: 2025-01-05

This project is a blueprint for a **personal finance dashboard** to track:

- Bank balances and interest rates
- Indian equity holdings + prices
- Mutual fund units + NAVs
- PPF holdings + interest
- Gold holdings and prices
- US stocks
- Credit card balances

The `Outline.txt` in the repo documents the thought process:

> What do we need to keep track of?  
> What should the dashboard show daily?  
> How can we alert on big moves?

Planned features include:

- Automatic price refreshes for market-linked instruments
- Daily net-worth time series and charts
- Allocation pie charts
- Telegram alerts when net worth moves by more than 2% or hits a new high

It ties my interests in **Python, markets, automation, and personal finance**.
