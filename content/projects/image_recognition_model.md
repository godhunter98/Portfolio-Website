This project implements a modern **Convolutional Neural Network** trained on the **Fashion-MNIST** dataset.

### Highlights

- Trained on 10,000+ images of clothing (bags, sneakers, shirts, t-shirts, etc.)
- Achieved around **98% accuracy** on the test set
- Includes:
  - Model definition (`model_class.py`)
  - Data utilities (`data.py`)
  - A small **Streamlit app** (`streamlit_app.py`) for interactive inference

It’s a concrete example of:

- Building and training a non-trivial model
- Structuring code into reusable components
- Wrapping models in a **simple app** for demos or stakeholders
