title: "Tkinter Stock Market Widget"

A small **desktop widget** built using Tkinter to track:

- Market indices
- Selected individual stocks

The goal was to have a lightweight, always-on-top widget that let me keep an eye on markets without a full browser or terminal session.

It is simple, but it shows:

- Comfort with **Tkinter** and UI basics
- Ability to turn an idea into a working tool, even if minimal
- Willingness to iterate on design and usability
