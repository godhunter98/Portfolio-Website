This repo extends the original `nano_transformers` work into a more experimental playground.

I use it to:

- Try out **sparser** or more efficient variants of the transformer
- Prototype changes to attention, batching, or training setups
- Keep my understanding fresh by tweaking and breaking things

It reflects how I learn: start with a clean baseline, then **iterate, refactor, and experiment**.
